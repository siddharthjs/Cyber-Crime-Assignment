## Introduction

The vast categorization of cyber crimes, including fraud, offenses against the person, illegal access, and data interference, among others, suggests that any security measure must be dynamic and adaptable. This diversity in threats necessitates that both the "Clean Desks" policy and the sophisticated entrance gate must not be static defenses but part of a continuously evolving security posture that anticipates and adapts to new forms of cybercrime.

## Expected Utility Calculation

The expected utility (EU) for the intruder is calculated by summing the products of the utilities of all outcomes and their respective probabilities. The utility of each outcome is determined by the gain or loss to the intruder.

### Probabilities:

1. **P_enter:** Probability of entering the restricted area = 50% or 0.5
2. **P_not_challenged_looking:** Probability of not being challenged while looking for target rooms = 90% or 0.9
3. **P_steal_loot:** Probability of stealing loot without being noticed = 50% or 0.5
4. **P_not_challenged_exit:** Probability of not being challenged on exit = 99% or 0.99
5. **P_caught_stealing:** Probability of being caught red-handed while stealing = 10% or 0.1
6. **P_challenged:** Probability of being challenged = 10% or 0.1
7. **P_convinces:** Probability of convincing if challenged = 50% or 0.5
8. **P_challenged_exit:** Probability of being challenged on way out = 1% or 0.01

### Utilities:

1. **U_success:** Utility of success (leaving with the loot) = +120,000 pounds
2. **U_failure:** Utility for failure (not obtaining loot or caught but not convicted) = -1,000 pounds
3. **U_heavy_punishment:** Utility for heavy punishment (caught with loot) = -100,000 pounds
4. **U_light_punishment:** Utility for light punishment (arrested without loot) = -10,000 pounds

### Calculations for Each Path:

1. **Success Path:** The intruder enters, is not challenged, steals the loot, and exits without challenge.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_not_challenged_looking * P_steal_loot * P_not_challenged_exit * U_success = 0.5 * 0.9 * 0.5 * 0.99 * 120,000 = 26,730 pounds
2. **Failed at Stealing, Exits Without Being Noticed:** The intruder enters, is not challenged, fails to steal, and exits without challenge.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_not_challenged_looking * (1 - P_steal_loot) * U_failure = 0.5 * 0.9 * (1 - 0.5) * -1,000 = -225 pounds
3. **Caught Red-handed While Stealing:** The intruder is caught in the act.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_caught_stealing * U_heavy_punishment = 0.5 * 0.1 * -100,000 = -5,000 pounds
4. **Challenged and Convinces:** The intruder is challenged but convinces the challenger and proceeds to steal the loot.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_challenged * P_convinces * P_steal_loot * U_success = 0.5 * 0.1 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 120,000 = 1,500 pounds
5. **Challenged, Fails to Convince, Arrested Without Loot:** The intruder is challenged, fails to convince, and is arrested without the loot.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_challenged * (1 - P_convinces) * U_light_punishment = 0.5 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.5) * -10,000 = -250 pounds
6. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Convinces:** The intruder exits with the loot, is challenged on the way out, but convinces the challenger.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_steal_loot * P_challenged_exit * P_convinces * U_success = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.01 * 0.5 * 120,000 = 150 pounds
7. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Fails to Convince, Arrested With Loot:** The intruder exits with the loot, is challenged on the way out, fails to convince, and is arrested with the loot.  
   Calculation: P_enter * P_steal_loot * P_challenged_exit * (1 - P_convinces) * U_heavy_punishment = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.01 * (1 - 0.5) * -100,000 = -125 pounds

### Total Expected Utility:

The total expected utility combines the utilities of all possible paths to provide an overall expected outcome for the intruder's decision to attack. Given the calculations above, the intruder's total expected utility is:  
26,730 (Success Path) − 225 (Failed Stealing) − 5,000 (Caught Red-handed) + 1,500 (Challenged and Convinces) − 250 (Challenged, Fails) + 150 (Exit, Convinces) − 125 (Exit, Fails) = 22,780 pounds.

## Decision According to Normative Theory

Given that the expected utility for the intruder is positive (22,780 pounds), according to normative decision theory, the rational choice for the intruder would be to "attack" rather than "do not attack," assuming their cost for not attacking is zero. This conclusion is drawn because a positive expected utility indicates that the overall outcome of the action (attacking) is favorable from the intruder's perspective.

## Option 1: Implementing 'Clean Desks' Policy

### Impact:

- Halves the probability of successfully stealing loot (from 50% to 25%).

### Cost:

- £12,000 per month in lost productivity.

### Expected Utility Calculations:

For each option, we need to recalculate the intruder's expected utility and the company's expected financial impact. The calculations will be based on the probabilities and utilities provided in the original question and the modified probabilities for each option.

We'll calculate the intruder's expected utility and the company's expected monthly cost for both options. Remember, the company's monthly cost includes the cost of the security measure plus any expected losses from successful intrusions. We'll also compare these to the intruder's original expected utility to see if their rational decision (attack or not attack) changes.

#### Recalculated Expected Utility:

1. **Success Path:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_not_challenged_looking * P_steal_loot_clean_desks * P_not_challenged_exit * U_success = 0.5 * 0.9 * 0.25 * 0.99 * 120000 = 13,365 pounds

2. **Failed at Stealing, Exits Without Being Noticed:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_not_challenged_looking * (1 - P_steal_loot_clean_desks) * U_failure = 0.5 * 0.9 * 0.75 * -1000 = -337.5 pounds

3. **Caught Red-handed While Stealing:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_caught_stealing * U_heavy_punishment = 0.5 * 0.1 * -100000 = -5,000 pounds

4. **Challenged and Convinces, then Steals:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_challenged * P_convinces * P_steal_loot_clean_desks * U_success = 0.5 * 0.1 * 0.5 * 0.25 * 120000 = 750 pounds

5. **Challenged, Fails to Convince, Arrested Without Loot:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_challenged * (1 - P_convinces) * U_light_punishment = 0.5 * 0.1 * 0.5 * -10000 = -250 pounds

6. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Convinces:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_steal_loot_clean_desks * P_challenged_exit * P_convinces * U_success = 0.5 * 0.25 * 0.01 * 0.5 * 120000 = 75 pounds

7. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Fails to Convince, Arrested With Loot:**
   Calculation: P_enter * P_steal_loot_clean_desks * P_challenged_exit * (1 - P_convinces) * U_heavy_punishment = 0.5 * 0.25 * 0.01 * 0.5 * -100000 = -62.5 pounds

### Total Expected Utility for 'Clean Desks' Policy:

EU_clean_desks = 13,365 - 337.5 - 5,000 + 750 - 250 + 75 - 62.5 = 8,540 pounds.

## Option 2: Installing Sophisticated Entrance Gate

### Impact:

- Reduces the probability of an intruder entering the restricted area by 75% (from 50% to 12.5%).

### Cost:

- £3,000 per month, including gate costs and lost productivity.

### Recalculated Expected Utility:

1. **Success Path:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_not_challenged_looking * P_steal_loot * P_not_challenged_exit * U_success = 0.125 * 0.9 * 0.5 * 0.99 * 120000 = 6,682.5 pounds

2. **Failed at Stealing, Exits Without Being Noticed:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_not_challenged_looking * (1 - P_steal_loot) * U_failure = 0.125 * 0.9 * 0.5 * -1000 = -56.25 pounds

3. **Caught Red-handed While Stealing:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_caught_stealing * U_heavy_punishment = 0.125 * 0.1 * -100000 = -1,250 pounds

4. **Challenged and Convinces, then Steals:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_challenged * P_convinces * P_steal_loot * U_success = 0.125 * 0.1 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 120000 = 375 pounds

5. **Challenged, Fails to Convince, Arrested Without Loot:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_challenged * (1 - P_convinces) * U_light_punishment = 0.125 * 0.1 * 0.5 * -10000 = -62.5 pounds

6. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Convinces:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_steal_loot * P_challenged_exit * P_convinces * U_success = 0.125 * 0.5 * 0.01 * 0.5 * 120000 = 37.5 pounds

7. **Exits With Loot, Challenged on Way Out, Fails to Convince, Arrested With Loot:**
   Calculation: P_enter_sophisticated_gate * P_steal_loot * P_challenged_exit * (1 - P_convinces) * U_heavy_punishment = 0.125 * 0.5 * 0.01 * 0.5 * -100000 = -31.25 pounds

### Total Expected Utility for Sophisticated Entrance Gate:

EU_sophisticated_gate = 6,682.5 - 56.25 - 1,250 + 375 - 62.5 + 37.5 - 31.25 = 5,695 pounds.

## Comparative Analysis

### Reduction in Expected Utility:

Both security measures effectively reduce the expected utility for potential intruders, albeit to different extents. The sophisticated entrance gate leads to a more considerable decrease in expected utility compared to the 'Clean Desks' policy. This suggests that making entry more challenging has a more substantial deterrent effect than making the final step of the attack (stealing loot undetected) harder. The sophisticated entrance gate addresses the threat at an earlier stage by preventing entry. The 'Clean Desks' policy, though impactful, relies on intruders bypassing initial security layers.

### Cost-Benefit Consideration:

The sophisticated entrance gate offers a more favorable cost-benefit ratio. Its lower monthly cost (£3,000) and significant impact on reducing intrusion probability make it a cost-effective deterrent. In contrast, the 'Clean Desks' policy, despite its higher cost (£12,000 per month), provides broader cultural security benefits that are harder to quantify financially.

### Long-Term Implications:

The entrance gate is a one-time investment with ongoing minimal costs, potentially offering enduring deterrence with little need for further intervention. The 'Clean Desks' policy requires continuous enforcement and cultural adaptation, which may vary in effectiveness over time.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Considering the direct impact on preventing unauthorized access, lower ongoing costs, and significant reduction in the expected utility for potential intruders, installing a sophisticated entrance gate emerges as the more strategic choice. This measure effectively decreases the likelihood of intrusion attempts by addressing the challenge at the point of entry, offering a strong deterrent effect that is both efficient and financially sensible.

While the 'Clean Desks' policy undeniably fosters a security-conscious workplace culture, its higher cost and dependency on consistent employee compliance make it a less favorable primary deterrent strategy. Nonetheless, it could serve as a valuable complementary measure to reinforce the overall security posture.

In light of these analyses, the recommendation is to prioritize the installation of the sophisticated entrance gate as the primary measure to deter potential intruders, potentially supported by the 'Clean Desks' policy for a layered defense strategy.

## Adjustments to the Analysis in Q1.b

### Cybercrime Diversity and Evolving Threats:

The vast categorization of cyber crimes, including fraud, offenses against the person, illegal access, and data interference, among others, suggests that any security measure must be dynamic and adaptable. This diversity in threats necessitates that both the 'Clean Desks' policy and the sophisticated entrance gate must not be static defenses but part of a continuously evolving security posture that anticipates and adapts to new forms of cybercrime.

### Human Factors in Security Compliance and Decision Making:

The emphasis on fraud and related offenses, such as phishing scams and identity theft, points to the significant role human behavior plays in cybersecurity risks. This insight calls for an adjustment in the analysis by incorporating strategies that not only focus on technical measures but also on educating and training employees to recognize and respond to cyber threats effectively. This human-centric approach should complement the 'Clean Desks' policy and sophisticated entrance gate implementations.

### Technological and Social Engineering Threats:

The discussion on various types of cyber fraud, especially those leveraging social engineering tactics, highlights the need for security measures that address both technological vulnerabilities and human susceptibilities. Therefore, in refining the analysis, it's crucial to consider how security measures can be designed to mitigate the risk of social engineering attacks, which may not be significantly deterred by physical security enhancements or policies like 'Clean Desks.'

### Risk Perception and Decision Making Under Uncertainty:

The exploration of decision-making under uncertainty, especially in the context of risk perception and the psychological aspects of security, suggests that the effectiveness of security measures also depends on how well they are perceived and adopted by the organization's members. Adjusting the analysis to account for these psychological factors, including the potential for over-reliance on technological solutions or underestimation of threat probabilities, is essential for a holistic cybersecurity strategy.

### Concluding Insights:

- **Integrating Technical and Behavioral Measures:** Security strategies must balance technical measures with behavioral approaches, emphasizing education, training, and a culture of security awareness.
- **Dynamic and Adaptive Security:** In the face of evolving cyber threats, security measures require continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment. A static defense is inadequate against the dynamic nature of cyber risks.
- **Psychological Aspects of Cybersecurity:** Addressing psychological factors that affect risk perception and decision-making can significantly enhance the efficacy of security measures. This includes combating complacency and fostering vigilance.
- **Customized Security Strategies:** Acknowledging the diversity of cyber threats and organizational susceptibilities, security strategies should be tailored to specific risks, combining technical defenses with human-centric solutions.

## Analysis of Risks of Use Error in System Administration Tasks: Setting File System Permissions on macOS

### Author:

### Date:

31st March 2024

### Product Category:

System Administration (Setting File System Permissions)

### Specific Instance:

macOS Catalina, Version 10.15.7

### Literature Review and Known Human Factor Problems:

Setting file system permissions on macOS Catalina involves intricate processes crucial for maintaining data security. Despite its robust Unix-based permissions system, the interface macOS provides for this task may lead to user errors, thereby compromising system security.

#### Over Reliance on GUI:

Many users prefer the macOS graphical user interface for its simplicity but may overlook the depth of control and precision offered by the command line, potentially leading to less secure configurations (Niezen et al., 2010).

#### Misinterpretation of Permission Levels:

Users often misunderstand the scope of 'Read & Write' permissions, granting broader access than necessary, which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized modifications.

#### Confusion Between User and Group Permissions:

Distinguishing between user and group permissions can be challenging, with users sometimes granting permissions to a wider audience than intended, thus increasing the risk of data breaches (Whitten & Tygar, 1999).

### Personal Use Observations:

Experimentation with setting file system permissions on macOS Catalina revealed several potential pitfalls:

1. **Accessing Folder Info:** The interface's subtlety in indicating that permissions are locked can lead users to believe their settings are already secure.

2. **Editing Permissions:** The layout of the permissions editing interface may lead to errors, such as incorrectly assigning 'Read & Write' permissions due to a misunderstanding of the GUI.

3. **Applying Permissions to Enclosed Items:** Failing to apply changes to enclosed items might leave parts of the system vulnerable despite a secure top-level configuration.

### Design and Usability Evaluation:

The usability of macOS's permission setting interface, when assessed against established principles, highlights areas needing improvement:

1. **Visibility of System Status:** The interface does not adequately convey the inheritance of permissions or the need to unlock settings before changes can be made.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World:** Terminology and conceptual models used in the interface might not align well with the user's understanding, leading to misconceptions and errors.

### Corrective Measures and Recommendations:

#### For Users and System Administrators:

1. **Command Line Training:** Enhancing familiarity with the command line can help leverage macOS's full capabilities for precise permission settings.

2. **Routine Security Audits:** Regular reviews of permission settings can prevent drift from intended security postures.

#### For Apple:

1. **Interface Redesign:** Improvements could include clearer visual cues for locked permissions and better feedback on the impact of changes.

2. **Enhanced Documentation:** Providing comprehensive, easily accessible guidance on setting permissions could reduce errors.

### Conclusion:

System administration tasks, such as setting file system permissions in macOS Catalina, entail complex decision-making that can be prone to user error. This analysis underscores the importance of both system design in mitigating these risks and the role of user education in ensuring data security.
